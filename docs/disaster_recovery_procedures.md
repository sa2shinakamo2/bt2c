# BT2C Disaster Recovery Procedures

This document outlines the comprehensive disaster recovery procedures for the BT2C blockchain network. It provides step-by-step instructions for various recovery scenarios and best practices for maintaining network resilience.

## Backup Procedures

### Full Backups

Full backups capture the entire state of the BT2C blockchain, including:
- Complete blockchain database
- Configuration files
- Validator keys (encrypted)

**To create a full backup:**

```bash
python tools/disaster_recovery.py backup --type full
```

Full backups should be performed:
- Before major network upgrades
- Weekly during normal operation
- After significant network events

### Incremental Backups

Incremental backups capture only the changes since the last full backup, including:
- New blocks
- New transactions
- Validator status changes

**To create an incremental backup:**

```bash
python tools/disaster_recovery.py backup --type incremental
```

Incremental backups should be performed:
- Hourly during normal operation
- After significant transaction volume

### Listing Available Backups

To view all available backups:

```bash
python tools/disaster_recovery.py list-backups
```

### Backup Storage Best Practices

1. **Multiple Locations**: Store backups in at least three separate physical locations
2. **Encryption**: Ensure all offsite backups are encrypted
3. **Regular Testing**: Test backup restoration quarterly
4. **Retention Policy**: 
   - Keep daily backups for 30 days
   - Keep weekly backups for 3 months
   - Keep monthly backups for 1 year

## Recovery Procedures

### Full Database Restoration

To restore the entire blockchain from a backup:

```bash
python tools/disaster_recovery.py restore --backup-file /path/to/backup.db
```

This will:
1. Create a backup of the current database (if it exists)
2. Restore the database from the backup file
3. Restore configuration files and keys if available

### Partial Restoration

For partial restoration (e.g., recovering specific transactions or blocks), contact the BT2C core development team.

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

| Scenario | Target RTO |
|----------|------------|
| Single validator failure | < 10 minutes |
| Multiple validator failures | < 30 minutes |
| Complete network outage | < 2 hours |
| Catastrophic data loss | < 8 hours |

## Key Recovery

### Validator Key Recovery

If validator keys are lost, they can be recovered using the original seed phrase:

```bash
python tools/disaster_recovery.py recover-keys --seed-phrase "your twelve word seed phrase here"
```

### Key Security Best Practices

1. **Seed Phrase Storage**: 
   - Store seed phrases in multiple secure locations
   - Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs)
   - Never store seed phrases in plain text on networked computers

2. **Key Rotation**:
   - Rotate validator keys every 6 months
   - Use a secure procedure for key rotation to maintain validator status

## Network Emergency Controls

### Emergency Network Pause

In case of critical security incidents or network attacks, the network can be paused:

```bash
python tools/disaster_recovery.py network pause
```

This will:
1. Set all validators to INACTIVE status
2. Prevent new block production
3. Create a network status record

### Network Resume

To resume normal network operation after an emergency:

```bash
python tools/disaster_recovery.py network resume
```

### Emergency Response Team

The Emergency Response Team should be activated for any of the following events:
- Security breach
- Network fork
- Multiple validator failures
- Significant data loss

## Integrity Verification

### Database Integrity Check

To verify the integrity of the blockchain database:

```bash
python tools/disaster_recovery.py verify-integrity
```

This checks for:
- Missing tables
- Blockchain discontinuities
- Duplicate blocks
- Orphaned transactions
- Invalid validator states

### Regular Verification Schedule

Perform integrity verification:
- Daily during normal operation
- After any recovery procedure
- Before and after network upgrades

## Automated Procedures

### Setting Up Automated Backups

To configure automated backups:

```bash
python tools/disaster_recovery.py setup-automated-backups
```

This will set up:
- Daily full backups at 2 AM
- Hourly incremental backups

### Monitoring and Alerting

The BT2C network includes automated monitoring for:
- Validator health
- Block production delays
- Network consensus issues
- Database integrity problems

Alerts are configured to notify the operations team via:
- Email
- SMS
- On-call paging system

## Disaster Recovery Testing

### Quarterly DR Testing

Perform a full disaster recovery test quarterly:

1. Create a test environment
2. Restore from the most recent backup
3. Verify network functionality
4. Document recovery time and any issues encountered

### Tabletop Exercises

Conduct disaster recovery tabletop exercises with the operations team monthly to ensure everyone understands the procedures and their roles.

### Test Scenarios

Test the following scenarios regularly:
- Single validator failure
- Multiple validator failures
- Complete network outage
- Database corruption
- Key compromise
