# BT2C Wallet Key Management

## Overview

This document describes the improved wallet key management system for the BT2C blockchain. The improvements address key security concerns identified in the audit, particularly around key derivation consistency and wallet recovery.

## Key Improvements

1. **Deterministic Key Derivation**
   - Ensures that the same seed phrase always produces the same keys
   - Critical for reliable wallet recovery
   - Implements cryptographically secure key generation

2. **Enhanced Security**
   - Stronger password protection with PBKDF2
   - Improved private key encryption
   - Secure storage of wallet data

3. **Consistent Recovery**
   - Reliable wallet recovery from seed phrases
   - Backward compatibility with existing wallets
   - Migration path for existing users

## Technical Implementation

### Deterministic Key Generator

The `DeterministicKeyGenerator` class provides a secure and consistent way to generate RSA key pairs from seed phrases:

```python
# Generate deterministic key pair from seed phrase
private_key, public_key = DeterministicKeyGenerator.generate_deterministic_key(seed_phrase)
```

Key features:
- Uses BIP39 standard for seed phrase to seed conversion
- Implements deterministic prime generation for RSA keys
- Ensures cryptographic security while maintaining consistency

### Wallet Key Manager

The `WalletKeyManager` class provides a comprehensive solution for wallet key management:

```python
# Create a wallet key manager
key_manager = WalletKeyManager()

# Generate a new wallet
wallet_data = key_manager.generate_wallet()

# Recover a wallet from seed phrase
recovered_wallet = key_manager.recover_wallet(seed_phrase)

# Save and load wallets
key_manager.save_wallet(wallet_data, filename, password)
loaded_wallet = key_manager.load_wallet(filename, password)
```

Key features:
- Deterministic wallet generation and recovery
- Secure storage of wallet data
- Password protection for wallet files
- Transaction signing and verification

## Migration Guide

### For Users

If you have existing wallets, you can migrate them to the new deterministic system using the wallet migration tool:

```bash
# Check if your wallets need migration
python scripts/wallet_migration_tool.py --check

# Migrate your wallets
python scripts/wallet_migration_tool.py --migrate

# Verify wallet recovery after migration
python scripts/wallet_migration_tool.py --verify
```

The migration process:
1. Creates a backup of your original wallet
2. Generates a new wallet with the same seed phrase
3. Verifies that the addresses match
4. Saves the new wallet in the deterministic format

### For Developers

To integrate the new wallet key management system into your code:

```python
from blockchain.wallet_key_manager import WalletKeyManager

# Create a wallet key manager
key_manager = WalletKeyManager()

# Use the key manager for wallet operations
wallet_data = key_manager.generate_wallet(seed_phrase)
```

## Security Considerations

### Key Strength

- RSA keys are 2048 bits (industry standard)
- Seed phrases have 256 bits of entropy
- Password-based encryption uses PBKDF2 with 1,000,000 iterations

### Best Practices

1. **Seed Phrase Security**
   - Store seed phrases securely, preferably offline
   - Never share seed phrases with anyone
   - Consider using a hardware wallet for additional security

2. **Password Security**
   - Use strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters)
   - Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Consider using a password manager

3. **Wallet Backup**
   - Regularly backup wallet files
   - Test recovery procedures periodically
   - Store backups in multiple secure locations

## Testing

The wallet key management system has been thoroughly tested to ensure:

1. **Key Derivation Consistency**
   - The same seed phrase always produces the same keys
   - Multiple recoveries from the same seed phrase are consistent

2. **Security Features**
   - Password protection works correctly
   - Private key encryption is secure
   - Transaction signing and verification are reliable

3. **Compatibility**
   - Backward compatibility with existing wallets
   - Smooth migration path for users

## Conclusion

The improved wallet key management system addresses critical security concerns identified in the audit. It provides a secure, reliable, and user-friendly solution for managing BT2C blockchain wallets.

By implementing deterministic key derivation, we ensure that users can reliably recover their wallets from seed phrases, which is essential for a robust cryptocurrency system.
