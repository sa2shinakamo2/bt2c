# BT2C (Bit2Coin) Technical Whitepaper
Version 1.1 (March 2025)

## Abstract
BT2C is a next-generation blockchain platform designed to provide a secure, scalable, and sustainable ecosystem for decentralized applications. This whitepaper outlines the technical specifications, economic model, and consensus mechanisms that power the BT2C network.

## 1. Economic Model

### 1.1 Token Supply and Distribution
- Maximum Supply: 21,000,000 BT2C
- Initial Block Reward: 21.0 BT2C
- Block Time: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Halving Period: 4 years (126,144,000 seconds)
- Minimum Block Reward: 0.00000001 BT2C
- Recommended Initial Price: $0.08 per BT2C

### 1.2 Validator Incentives
- Developer Node Reward: 1000 BT2C (one-time reward for first mainnet validator)
- Early Validator Reward: 1.0 BT2C (first 100 validators)
- Distribution Period: 14 days
- All distribution period rewards are automatically staked

### 1.3 Staking Requirements
- Minimum Stake: 1.0 BT2C
- Dynamic APY based on:
  * Total network stake
  * Individual stake amount
  * Validator performance metrics
  * Network participation duration

## 2. Validator System

### 2.1 Reputation-Based Selection
Validators are selected based on a weighted probability system that considers:
- Staked amount
- Historical performance
- Network uptime
- Transaction throughput
- Block validation accuracy

### 2.2 Distribution Period
- 14-day initial distribution period from mainnet launch
- Open to all validators who join during this period
- Each validator receives 1.0 BT2C reward upon joining
- Dynamic budget based on validator participation
- Auto-staking of rewards during distribution period
- First validator receives additional 1000 BT2C developer reward

### 2.3 Validator Incentives
- Distribution period rewards (1.0 BT2C per validator)
- Developer node reward (1000 BT2C for first validator)
- Block validation rewards (starting at 21.0 BT2C)
- Transaction fees from processed transactions
- Dynamic APY based on network participation

### 2.4 Staking Mechanics
- Flexible staking/unstaking (maintaining minimum stake)
- No fixed minimum staking period
- Exit queue for unstaking requests
- Continued rewards until unstaking processed

## Technical Architecture

BT2C is designed as a pure cryptocurrency focused on secure value transfer and storage. Like Bitcoin, BT2C does not support smart contracts or decentralized applications (dapps). This intentional limitation helps maintain the network's simplicity, security, and efficiency.

The core features of BT2C include:
- Proof of Stake consensus
- Secure value transfer
- Validator staking and rewards
- Dynamic validator participation
- Automated reward distribution

By focusing solely on these core features without the complexity of smart contracts, BT2C aims to be a reliable and efficient cryptocurrency for value storage and transfer.

## 3. Security Architecture

### 3.1 Cryptographic Standards
- 2048-bit RSA keys
- BIP39 seed phrases (256-bit)
- BIP44 HD wallets
- Password-protected storage
- SSL/TLS encryption

### 3.2 Network Security
- Dynamic transaction fees
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute
- Reputation-based validator selection
- Secure P2P communication

## 4. Technical Infrastructure

### 4.1 Database Layer
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Redis for caching and performance
- Optimized indexing
- ACID compliance

### 4.2 Monitoring and Metrics
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Grafana dashboards
- Performance monitoring
- Network health indicators

### 4.3 Network Infrastructure
- Mainnet Domains:
  * Primary: bt2c.net
  * API: api.bt2c.net
  * Block Explorer: bt2c.net/explorer
- Load balancing
- DDoS protection
- Geographic distribution

## 5. Governance and Future Development

### 5.1 Protocol Upgrades
- On-chain governance
- Validator voting
- Technical improvement proposals
- Community feedback integration

### 5.2 Economic Adjustments
- Dynamic fee market
- Stake-weighted voting
- Parameter optimization
- Reward rate adjustments

## 6. Conclusion
BT2C combines proven blockchain technology with innovative features to create a sustainable and efficient platform for decentralized applications. The economic model, with its carefully balanced incentives including the 1000 BT2C developer reward and 1.0 BT2C early validator rewards, ensures long-term network security and growth.
