# BT2C (Bit2Coin) Whitepaper
Version 1.0 - March 2025

## Abstract
BT2C (Bit2Coin) is a next-generation digital store of value that combines Bitcoin's proven economic model with an energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Built on a foundation of security, scalability, and decentralization, BT2C implements a unique reputation-based validator system while maintaining Bitcoin's core principles of fixed supply and periodic reward halving.

## 1. Introduction
BT2C represents a significant evolution in digital store of value assets, addressing the environmental concerns of Proof of Work while maintaining the economic principles that made Bitcoin successful. By implementing a reputation-based Proof of Stake system, BT2C achieves energy efficiency without compromising security or decentralization.

### 1.1 Core Principles
- Fixed maximum supply of 21 million BT2C
- Periodic reward halving every 4 years
- Energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus
- Reputation-based validator selection
- Secure, deterministic wallet generation
- Transparent and verifiable network operation

## 2. Economic Model
