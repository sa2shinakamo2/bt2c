# BT2C: A Pure Cryptocurrency Implementation with Reputation-Based Proof of Stake
Version 1.2 (March 19, 2025)

## Abstract

This paper introduces BT2C (bit2coin), a cryptocurrency designed to function as a pure medium of exchange and store of value without the overhead of smart contracts or decentralized applications. We present a novel reputation-based Proof of Stake (rPoS) consensus mechanism that addresses the energy consumption concerns of Proof of Work while maintaining security properties through cryptographic verification and economic incentives. BT2C implements a deterministic issuance schedule with a fixed maximum supply, combined with a flexible staking model that optimizes for network security and validator participation. This paper outlines the technical architecture, cryptographic foundations, consensus rules, and economic model of the BT2C network.

## 1. Economic Model
### Supply and Issuance
- Maximum supply: 21,000,000 BT2C
- Initial block reward: 21.0 BT2C
- Halving period: Every 4 years (126,144,000 seconds)
- Minimum reward: 0.00000001 BT2C

### Transaction Fee Structure
- Dynamic fees based on network load
- Fee distribution between validators and delegators
- Minimum fee: 0.00001 BT2C

## 2. Validator System
### Requirements and Rewards
- Minimum stake: 1.0 BT2C

### Initial Distribution
- Distribution period: 14 days
- Early validator reward: 1.0 BT2C (automatically staked)
- One-time developer node reward: 100 BT2C (first validator only)
- All distribution period rewards are automatically staked
- After distribution period ends, standard staking rules apply:
  * Flexible staking/unstaking
  * Exit queue system
  * Dynamic APY based on performance

### Staking Mechanism
- Flexible staking: No fixed minimum staking period
- Validators can stake and unstake at any time, maintaining the minimum 1.0 BT2C requirement
- Rewards accrue over time, incentivizing longer-term staking
- Dynamic APY based on network participation and total staked amount

### Unstaking Process
- Withdrawal requests enter an exit queue
- Queue processing time varies based on network conditions
- If many validators are exiting simultaneously, wait times may increase
- Exit queue prevents mass unstaking events and maintains network stability
- Validators remain active and earn rewards until their unstaking request is processed

### Selection Mechanism
- Reputation-based selection
- Performance metrics tracking:
  * Uptime and response time
  * Block validation accuracy
  * Network participation quality
- Higher reputation leads to increased block rewards

### Staking Rewards
- No minimum staking period required
- Rewards accrue over time to incentivize long-term participation
- Dynamic APY based on:
  * Total network stake
  * Individual stake amount
  * Validator performance metrics:
    - Block validation accuracy
    - Network uptime
    - Response time
    - Transaction throughput
  * Network participation duration

### Reputation Mechanism
- Reputation scores are calculated based on performance metrics:
  * Block validation accuracy
  * Network uptime and response time
  * Transaction processing efficiency
  * Historical participation quality
- Reputation affects:
  * Validator selection priority for block creation
  * Block reward distribution multiplier
  * Exit queue priority (higher reputation = faster processing)
- Reputation scores are publicly visible for transparency
- Scores persist across staking/unstaking cycles
- Performance metrics are weighted based on network conditions

## 3. Security Model
### Cryptographic Foundation
- 2048-bit RSA keys
- BIP39 seed phrases (256-bit entropy)
- BIP44 HD wallet structure
- Password-protected storage
- SSL/TLS encryption for all network communication

### Network Security
- Distributed validator set
- Byzantine fault tolerance
- Double-spend protection
- Transaction signature verification
- Secure recovery processes

## 4. Technical Architecture
### Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- Redis caching for performance optimization
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- Grafana dashboards for visualization

### Network Parameters
- Target block time: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Dynamic transaction fees
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute
- Mainnet domains:
  * bt2c.net (main website)
  * api.bt2c.net (API endpoint)
  * bt2c.net/explorer (block explorer interface)

## 5. Future Development
### Planned Features
- Cross-chain bridges
- Smart contract support
- Layer 2 scaling solutions
- Enhanced privacy features

### Governance
- On-chain voting mechanism
- Protocol upgrade process
- Community-driven development
- Research and development funding

## 6. Conclusion
BT2C represents a significant evolution in digital store of value assets, addressing the environmental concerns of Proof of Work while maintaining the economic principles that made Bitcoin successful. Through its reputation-based Proof of Stake system, BT2C achieves both energy efficiency and robust security.
